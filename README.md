Hi! I am Athena (Hiu Ching CHEUNG)!

I am an MPhil student specializing in unmanned aerial systems and soft robotics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am affiliated with the High-speed Thermo-fluid and MAV/UAV Laboratory (AIRo Lab) at the Research Centre for Unmanned Autonomous Systems (RCUAS), led by Prof. Chih‐yung WEN and Dr. Li‐ta HSU. Additionally, I am under co‐supervision by Dr Henry K. CHU, focusing on the field of soft robotics. I am expected to complete my MPhil degree by August 2024.

My passion lies in robotics, and I am dedicated to exploring and researching new technologies in this field. Currently, I am passionate about developing soft unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that solve real-world issues. With my MPhil thesis titled "Design and Control of a Soft Aerial Vehicle for Conducting Aerial Grasping," I am currently engaged in research on autonomous unmanned aerial grasping with a pneumatic soft gripper for applications such as search and rescue, environmental cleaning, and harvesting. The primary focus of my research is to ensure the safety of goods during aerial grasping operations and to enhance flight efficiency. To enhance the precision of the proposed soft aerial vehicle, I am implementing model predictive control (MPC) for autonomous aerial grasping, utilizing an indoor motion capture system to minimize tracking errors.
